# Hello-World
Join me so we can code together.

Hi People!

ThaELL1 here I've been coding/ editing free templetes for for about 2yrs now. I took an online course on how to build a websiite business in 21 days which i have been using to edit codes. Now i'm backing up a bit to deep dive into writting codes. I can tear-a-part
a templete/ admin cart templete like "Softaculous". But can't code from scrach so i'm here. Can we learn together.
